    "Flow measurement tries to gather metadata on existing flows like the presence of certain features, the average volume, or peak volumes. Measuring the flow data is indispensable in a number of applications such as traffic analysis, network visibility, congestion control, heavy-hitter detection, anomaly detection, and intrusion detection.\n",

    "For network flow measurement on high-speed networks, especially when the focus is on hardware, we need to prioritize two things to enable processing at line-rate: high-speed lookup and high-speed counting. Keeping the memory and storage requirement within the on-chip memory is the best way to reduce the latency in lookup and counting, and this can be done by using efficient probabilistic lookup data structures and approximate counting techniques. In this tutorial, we focus only on high-speed lookup. However, a useful introduction to approximate counting is given in the closing notebook.\n",

    "In this exercise we take flow size/flow volume as our parameter and we consider measuring/counting the flow size/flow volume of flow IDs to detect an anomaly and intrusion. We define **flow size** as the number of packets and **flow volume** as the byte volume of packets. We start with flow size first and later with flow volume.\n",
